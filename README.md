# NCAA-ML-Competition
The competition was posted on Kaggle and the goal is to predict the 2019 Men's NCAA Tournament using a model. 
The first model was given by Google as a into Kernel.
The scond model used the Google model with a guessing feature presented by a Top 5 finisher in the competition.
The third model will be my own work using metrics and models I think may work.
